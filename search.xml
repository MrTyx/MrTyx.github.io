      <title><![CDATA[The 4-Hour Work Week]]></title>
      <url>/2017/06/19/The-4-Hour-Work-Week/</url>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For more than a year, I have been meaning to read Tim Ferriss’s famous book which was semi-written for millennials. If you tend to read certain subreddits (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependance" target="_blank" rel="external">/r/financialindependance</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/stoicism" target="_blank" rel="external">/r/stoicism</a>, etc) as I do then you will see his name come up on book recommendation threads. I also have friends who are into self improvement content, and they have been hounding me to read it so we can discuss it.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<div class="bookcover"><br>  <img src="/images/bookcovers/The-4-Hour-Work-Week.jpg" height="185"><br></div>

<h2 id="Reactionary-attitude-towards-time-wasters"><a href="#Reactionary-attitude-towards-time-wasters" class="headerlink" title="Reactionary attitude towards time wasters"></a>Reactionary attitude towards time wasters</h2><p>His attitude towards time is clearly a result of having experienced being yet another small cog in yet another large corporate machine. He wants to work from home because he works faster without office disruptions. And who cares if you complete eight hours of work in one, because most of that eight is corporate paper pushing as an exercise in inefficiency. Therefore if you can work from home, you can get all your paper pushed as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>When I’ve heard managers argue against working from home, it has been for this exact reason. That without a manager checking over their employees’ shoulders, an employee will produce the minimal threshold of work to fulfill the requirements. This creates an overhead of chasing up your employees which does not exist if I can see their computer screen from my desk. And time spent in the office is more than just work, but about building a team culture which produces a positive feedback loop on the output of the business.</p>
<p>You can see the clash between a collectivistic and individualistic attitude here. A collectivist attitude cares firstly about the business, and can even translate that into terms the individualist attitude can understand. “We are all in the same boat, sink or swim”. The issue Tim Ferriss is addressing is the individualist employee who has a complete view of this interaction and yet still wants to go kite surfing, the business be damned. Now where the reader stands on that will be reflected on their opinion of time theft.</p>
<h2 id="Hire-an-Indian"><a href="#Hire-an-Indian" class="headerlink" title="Hire an Indian"></a>Hire an Indian</h2><p>One of Tim’s main arguments is to automate huge chunks of your life. What about tasks that require a minimum level of human decision making? Hire an Indian. You can get a personal assistant, that understands English and how to use a computer for $4.50 per hour. For example, farming the contact details for a list of people who match certain criteria.</p>
<p>It reminds me of this craze in Silicon Valley where rich people pay young healthy people for blood transfusions because it will extend their lifespan. Which is a great example of the human fear of the inevitability of death. I remember learning about this when Hulk Hogan’s court case was a big deal because apparently Peter Thiel does this? Anyway, to the point. So if this blood is aging you, does the young healthy donor age faster? Then are you basically buying years from someone else’s life? For a book about not wasting your precious hours, how do you, the reader, feel about this?</p>
<p>Imagine you are in a pointless meeting, and you offer to pay your boss $50 to let you leave. Now imagine you skip the meeting, and pay an Indian to summarize the minutes of that meeting for $50. Ponder the differences. The business is the source of the inefficiency and you are taking advantage of how poor this third party is, to buy back the time the business is wasting.</p>
<p> And I totally get why. Trying to solve the underlying issue is going to be impossible. You’d be trying to change the work culture in your whole industry. You can do this to an extent, carve out a small pocket of sanity. This is what he does when he enforces a policy of doing business through emails. But that only goes so far, so you hire a personal assistant. And that makes total sense. But, man, just to start, its depressing as hell.</p>
<h2 id="The-book-is-part-of-the-argument"><a href="#The-book-is-part-of-the-argument" class="headerlink" title="The book is part of the argument"></a>The book is part of the argument</h2><p>In the book, Tim writes that one of the easiest ways to a four hour work week is to create a niche product that you can sell online, preferably digital. Then after you have built up the necessary platform and ad base, you can move to automating the process. Then you sit back, put your feet up, and enjoy profits roll in. For example, write a book.</p>
<p>In order for your book to sell, you need to become an “expert” on a topic. That comes from having validation from a respectable source, such as a certification body. Ok, so this is where the problem comes in. Is Tim Ferriss a respectable source for entrepreneurship advice? Yes. Because he started a successful supplement product line. He was validated by the free market.</p>
<p>So is the book, just another source of passive income for Tim? Could it be, that he got lucky, then realizing that he could claim it was part of a proven process, he could create a positive feedback loop. He writes a book, that at the most basic level is just saying “create sources of passive income”, of which the book is a passive source of income for him. He’s not lying, but what he is selling isn’t what you think it is.</p>
<p>Because you buy the book, assuming it is an instruction manual that you can use to duplicate his success. Which it could be. But you don’t know that, because it could equally be in the author’s interest to lie to you and sell you a book full of dreams. He wants people to think its possible, because then his passive income works and then it becomes possible. But only for him.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>I had more thoughts, but this was about the amount that I wanted to write. I definitely gleaned some good advice, and I think I will keep my eyes open for niche markets in the next few years at university. But I also can see why he gets called a douchebag. Consider the following from the book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Learn to be difficult when it counts. In school as in life, having a reputation for being assertive will help you receive preferential treatment without having to beg or fight for it every time.”</p>
<p>― <strong>Timothy Ferriss, The 4-Hour Workweek</strong></p>
</blockquote>

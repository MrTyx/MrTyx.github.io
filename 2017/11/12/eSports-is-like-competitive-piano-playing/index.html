As you move back up the recursive stack, each set of child tasks has a parent task which has the responsibility of monitoring the error rates of each of children. These error rates account for both on the individual mandates of that machine and their effects on the larger whole. This formula is how you learn the piano, and in esports it is elevated to a new level of complexity when forced to factor in the natural selection of playstyles in a changing meta.</p>

<h2 id="How-are-my-fingers-playing-WoW"><a href="#How-are-my-fingers-playing-WoW" class="headerlink" title="How are my fingers playing WoW?"></a>How are my fingers playing WoW?</h2><p>There is an ability that in World of Warcraft that Priests have called <em>Psychic Scream</em>. It forces all enemies around the player run away from the Priest. This includes the ingame monsters and players from the enemy faction. Ingame monsters are called <em>Mobs</em>. Having a player attack you is called “getting ganked” where the attacking player is the <em>Ganker</em>. Forcing something to run away from you is called a <em>Fear</em> effect. During a Fear effect, the character who is running away is uncontrollable. That means, if you get ganked by a member of the enemy faction, you can cast Psychic Scream fear everything around you, which allows you to run away. Abilities like Psychic Scream are called <em>Panic Buttons</em> by the community.</p>
<p>Your base layer motor machines, those with the quality of being indivisible, are at play when you map an spell to a hotkey. You drag a spell from your spellbook to your actionbar where you have associated a hotkey. For most players, their hands will be on the WASD keys. Therefore you might put Psychic Scream on the T key, where it is reachable by your index finger of your left hand. When you do this, you create the mental machine that is responsible for pushing that button. It is exactly the same as how we train ourselves to push specific keys on a piano. It is a shard of your psyche that knows how to move that finger over, and push down the button. When I think “Cast Psychic Scream”, how that is achieved is this machine’s job.</p>
<p>You have an event emitter that is parsing input from the screen. Individual pixels combine to represent an element in the digital landscape. Everything. Terrain, mobs, other players, mining nodes etc. That parsing process makes the event emitter chatter constantly with everything it sees. Some things, such as a rare mob or a member of the enemy faction, make the event emitter shout. </p>
<p>As you create your Psychic Scream machine, you give it the ability to listen. You let it listen to the event emitter. When a Rogue materializes behind you, your internal event emitter starts shouting “ROGUE!” like a blaring siren. Your Psychic Scream machine responds. Maybe the first few ganks, all of your panic button machinery fires at once which produces a panicked state. But after a few ganks, the parent of those individual panic buttons learns to serialize them into a combo. You learn to take the event of “getting ganked” and tie it to a series of motor functions, which could be “Psychic Scream, then Shadowmeld, then use my Mount”.</p>
<p>Once you have that, as we move recursively up the stack, we have exponentially more decision trees and interconnected hubs of complex motor functions. For example, players getting ganked will often have three choices; <em>Fight</em>, <em>Flee</em> or <em>Give Up</em>. Fleeing is an interesting choice because where are you fleeing to? Safety. Safety is towns. Towns have elite guards. Elite guards protect you from the opposing faction. One Elite is stronger than One Player. So if you get ganked, you should run to a town.</p>
<p>Ok, so now you need a machine to track the nearest town and continually update itself as you move about in the world (of warcraft). Which direction is it and how far? This is non-trivial because in moving about and rotating your character you could disorient yourself, resulting in death during a gank. And this machine needs to be aware of how fast you could get to safety. All of this continually updating information is factored in when this machine is asked to make a decision. </p>
<p>“ROGUE ROGUE ROGUE!!!” Can you make it to safety? It needs to be able to calculate and reach a decision of a course of action instantly and therefore trigger the motor functions for that relevant course of action.</p>
<h2 id="Why-eSports-is-like-piano-players"><a href="#Why-eSports-is-like-piano-players" class="headerlink" title="Why eSports is like piano players"></a>Why eSports is like piano players</h2><p>A piano player will have machines for individual keys. Those machines will have parent machines for a chord. Those will have parent machines for a series of chords which make up a part of a musical piece. A player wanting to perfect a musical piece will master all of the individual machines in the stack, because perfection in all the parts produces perfection in the whole.</p>
<p>After attaining perfection, they can respond to stimulation (such as their band, the crowd or their mood) to modify the machines inside a certain range. That is the personal flair that a musician can put on any individual song to give it a unique flavour, by giving it a “jazzy feel”, by slightly varying the individual motor functions.</p>
<p>In eSports, that external stimulation is a enemy player. A intelligient create who has a process which mirrors yours in that it is undergoing the same evolution. You don’t quite have that in music. I think the closest is that when you play in a band, you need to adapt to the tempo of your fellow musicians. But that is a harmonious process, and not the same as competition. Bands that have competition between their players don’t often survive. Bands are not battlefields.</p>
<p>Let us call the machine which interacts with other players a <em>playstyle</em>. This is the thematically similar to the musician’s personal flair. A playstyle is based on some rigid structure, much like how a musical piece is transcribed, but then is modified in some range by each player with experimental variations. The interaction of a population of playstyles produces trends, which are call <em>The Meta</em>. The meta is the aggregate of the playstyles of the population of players, the norm, the range of expected values. Experimental individuals are “playing outside the meta”.</p>
<p>Sometimes an individual player will attempt to create a new playstyle. This will require examining their entire structural stack. It is a cognitively difficult task. Most players will never attempt this. This analysis produces a hypothesis of a superior alternative. The player then makes the changes to their parent processes which make recursive changes down the entire hierarchy to the motor functions.</p>
<p>If at the end of this experiment, the individual player has indeed created a superior playstyle, it sends out ripples through the population of players who pay attention to the meta. Those players will now adapt to the existence of this new playstyle. This is called the meta shifting. For a game to be considered satisfying to competitive esports players, the meta needs to be constantly shifting. If necessary, the developers of the game need to “keep it fresh” by making changes to mechanisms which serve as inspiration for individuals to produce these ripples.</p>
<p>This entire lifecycle is what it would look like if we applied evolutionary principles to playing the piano. The competitive and warlike theme is necessary to force the root process to become dynamic to dynamic processes, other players. This appeals to young men, because of two reasons; first that if they perfect the motor functions they can perfect the whole of the structure, and second because if they can perfect the ability to read and adapt to the meta, they will be at the top of the hierarchy of players.</p>
<h2 id="Final-thoughts"><a href="#Final-thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Final thoughts"></a>Final thoughts</h2><p>I think one of the reasons the military forces recruits to perfect their bed making skills is because the recruit will be forced to subdivide a “perfect bed” into indivisible parts, and then perfect each one. This teaches the recruit how to do something perfectly. It’s the same with playing piano, or mastering a DPS rotation. However, when forced to adapt to a process which itself can adapt, you create the environment for evolution. Experimental players drive that evolution, but at the high individual cost of remapping entire substructures.</p>
<p><a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/InSec#Trivia" target="_blank" rel="external">But perhaps now you can understand better why young male League of Legends fans cared that inSec changed the entire meta with his Lee Sin combos.</a></p>
